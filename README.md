# Cosmetic store website

## Overview:

A First part of E-commerce cosmetic store created in React.js. In this page there are mainly ui functionalities such as: adding products to the cart, removing products from the list and various filtering products options. Moreover, products from the shopping cart are stored in the local storage. This project uses React.js, React-Router-dom for navigation, Contentful CMS for dynamically updating the data and Styled-components/Material-UI for layout styles.

### The Most significant features:

- adding products to cart,
- deleting products from cart,
- increasing/decreasing products quantity,
- current number of products in shopping bag and a total sum for purchases,
- filtering products by category, price, name or choosing a free delivery option,
- picking a discounted random products from the products carousel,
- shopping products are stored in the local storage,
- paying for purchases using PayPal sandbox,
- leaving a message via contact form.

## Future updates and modernisation:

In addition, the database will be also crated to store all the customers details and purchase histories.
